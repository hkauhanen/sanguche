Started mrbayes_small on both WALS and Grambank simultaneously.
Observation: first family on WALS (Nakh-Dagestanian) went to GPU by BEAGLE's autoestimation, first family on Grambank (Pama-Nyungan) went to CPU! Second family on Grambank went to GPU (whilst first family on WALS is still being operated on same GPU).

Mon 2 Sep @ 13:45
First family converged (Maiduan, on Grambank). Interrupted WALS analysis and set nex filesize limit to 300 KB instead of 500 KB.

Mon 2 Sep @ 14:50
Grambank interrupted and also switched to the 300KB limit. By now, two (Grambank) families have converged.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:20
Third family converges on Grambank: Koiarian.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:30
Interrupted both; increased nstep to 1M for small families; redefined size cut to be at 100KB instead. Thus, families with nex files > 100KB have nstep 100K, and families with < 100KB have nstep 1M.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:45
First WALS family (Mongolic) converges.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:50
Second WALS family (Chocoan) converges.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:05
Grambank completed, either because all small (< 100KB) families have converged, or because we reached max_iteration. 

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:10
All of Grambank small converged for sure.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:25
Running revbayes on Grambank whilst the small mrbayes families on WALS are still running.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:40
Running CTMC model on Grambank whilst waiting for WALS mrbayes to converge. As for the latter, Chibchan seems to be troublesome once again...

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:45
All of WALS small (<100 KB) has converged, apart from Chibchan.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:55
Interrupted WALS; doing revbayes instead. Waiting for Grambank CTMC to finish.

Mon 2 Sep @ 17:50
Doing the CTMC on WALS as well; once that's finished, will launch mrbayes_large on both WALS and Grambank and leave that running.

Tue 3 Sep @ 12:25
Families converged: 53/75 WALS, 50/81 Grambank.

Tue 3 Sep @ 14:30
Interrupted one of the datasets, as analyses were starting to complain of not enough GPU memory. Not sure which one got interrupted, but I'm assuming Grambank. If so, then WALS continues. Numbers of converged families at this time: 53/75 and 51/81.

Tue 3 Sep @ 15:50
Converged: 54/75.

Tue 3 Sep @ 17:35
Read in the MrBayes manual that multithreading is a bad idea if using GPU. Hence, splitting this into two strategies now: either use 1 CPU + 1 GPU, or 8 CPU + 0 GPU. Both datasets are running. Indeed, it seems to be faster now. Families converged: 56/75 WALS, 51/81 Grambank. Listening to Takeo Ischi (!) to keep the animal spirits flowing.

Tue 3 Sep @ 18:15
Families converged: 56/75 WALS, 52/81 Grambank. Leaving this running; will check again either tomorrow or on Thursday.

Thu 5 Sep @ 10:30
Families converged: 68/75 WALS, 72/81 Grambank. Grambank has stopped, not sure why. Halting WALS as well, going to install second GPU!

Thu 5 Sep @ 14:10
Families converged: 68/75 WALS, 72/81 Grambank. Stopped each analysis in order to obtain posterior distributions and run the model and correlations on this set of families. After that, will continue MrBayes analysis with remaining families.

Thu 5 Sep @ 14:15
On second thought, it is enough to stop just one of the MrBayes analyses, as these now happen on the GPU whilst model and correlations are computed on the CPU. Hence, now doing model and correlations and WALS, and MrBayes on Grambank, simultaneously.

Thu 5 Sep @ 14:45
New GPU reports "unknown error"! However, mb still seems to be running...

Thu 5 Sep @ 15:15
WALS model + correlations finished. So: it takes about an hour for one dataset..

Thu 5 Sep @ 16:00
Having restarted computer, both GPUs are recognized again... running analyses again. However, will now exclude Austronesian temporarily, as it turns out to be so problematic. Hoping that, by tomorrow, some of the other remaining families will have converged. Also: restarted Atlantic-Congo and Nakh-Dagestanian in WALS from scratch, as these families were constantly exiting with errors, perhaps something to do with checkpointing gone awry.

Thu 5 Sep @ 17:45
Families converged: 69/75 WALS, 72/81 Grambank.

Thu 5 Sep @ 18:30
Families converged still at 69/75 WALS, 72/81 Grambank. Going home!

Fri 6 Sep @ 10:30
Families converged: 69/75, 75/81. New GPU has again disappeared (???).

Fri 6 Sep @ 12:40
Changing nstep from 100K to 1M. MrBayes reports parameters may be undersampled for certain families. Also swapping GPUs between families, so that WALS goes on the "good" one, i.e. the one that has never crashed so far.

Fri 6 Sep @ 13:45
Families converged still at the same values. Going to disable Metropolis coupling now (nchains=1), perhaps we don't need heated chains, at least not for all families.

Fri 6 Sep @ 13:50
Ah nope - the above won't work, can't continue with one chain from a checkpoint that used 4 chains. So reverting back to four chains again now.
