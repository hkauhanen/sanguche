Started mrbayes_small on both WALS and Grambank simultaneously.
Observation: first family on WALS (Nakh-Dagestanian) went to GPU by BEAGLE's autoestimation, first family on Grambank (Pama-Nyungan) went to CPU! Second family on Grambank went to GPU (whilst first family on WALS is still being operated on same GPU).

First family converged (Maiduan, on Grambank). Interrupted WALS analysis and set nex filesize limit to 300 KB instead of 500 KB.

Mon 2 Sep @ 14:50
Grambank interrupted and also switched to the 300KB limit. By now, two (Grambank) families have converged.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:20
Third family converges on Grambank: Koiarian.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:30
Interrupted both; increased nstep to 1M for small families; redefined size cut to be at 100KB instead. Thus, families with nex files > 100KB have nstep 100K, and families with < 100KB have nstep 1M.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:45
First WALS family (Mongolic) converges.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:50
Second WALS family (Chocoan) converges.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:05
Grambank completed, either because all small (< 100KB) families have converged, or because we reached max_iteration. 

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:10
All of Grambank small converged for sure.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:25
Running revbayes on Grambank whilst the small mrbayes families on WALS are still running.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:40
Running CTMC model on Grambank whilst waiting for WALS mrbayes to converge. As for the latter, Chibchan seems to be troublesome once again...

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:45
All of WALS small (<100 KB) has converged, apart from Chibchan.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:55
Interrupted WALS. Instead, doing revbayes and the CTMC on WALS as well, so we have some tangible results.
