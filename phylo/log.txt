Started mrbayes_small on both WALS and Grambank simultaneously.
Observation: first family on WALS (Nakh-Dagestanian) went to GPU by BEAGLE's autoestimation, first family on Grambank (Pama-Nyungan) went to CPU! Second family on Grambank went to GPU (whilst first family on WALS is still being operated on same GPU).

Mon 2 Sep @ 13:45
First family converged (Maiduan, on Grambank). Interrupted WALS analysis and set nex filesize limit to 300 KB instead of 500 KB.

Mon 2 Sep @ 14:50
Grambank interrupted and also switched to the 300KB limit. By now, two (Grambank) families have converged.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:20
Third family converges on Grambank: Koiarian.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:30
Interrupted both; increased nstep to 1M for small families; redefined size cut to be at 100KB instead. Thus, families with nex files > 100KB have nstep 100K, and families with < 100KB have nstep 1M.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:45
First WALS family (Mongolic) converges.

Mon 2 Sep @ 15:50
Second WALS family (Chocoan) converges.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:05
Grambank completed, either because all small (< 100KB) families have converged, or because we reached max_iteration. 

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:10
All of Grambank small converged for sure.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:25
Running revbayes on Grambank whilst the small mrbayes families on WALS are still running.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:40
Running CTMC model on Grambank whilst waiting for WALS mrbayes to converge. As for the latter, Chibchan seems to be troublesome once again...

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:45
All of WALS small (<100 KB) has converged, apart from Chibchan.

Mon 2 Sep @ 16:55
Interrupted WALS; doing revbayes instead. Waiting for Grambank CTMC to finish.

Mon 2 Sep @ 17:50
Doing the CTMC on WALS as well; once that's finished, will launch mrbayes_large on both WALS and Grambank and leave that running.

Tue 3 Sep @ 12:25
Families converged: 53/75 WALS, 50/81 Grambank.

Tue 3 Sep @ 14:30
Interrupted one of the datasets, as analyses were starting to complain of not enough GPU memory. Not sure which one got interrupted, but I'm assuming Grambank. If so, then WALS continues. Numbers of converged families at this time: 53/75 and 51/81.

Tue 3 Sep @ 15:50
Converged: 54/75.

Tue 3 Sep @ 17:35
Read in the MrBayes manual that multithreading is a bad idea if using GPU. Hence, splitting this into two strategies now: either use 1 CPU + 1 GPU, or 8 CPU + 0 GPU. Both datasets are running. Indeed, it seems to be faster now. Families converged: 56/75 WALS, 51/81 Grambank. Listening to Takeo Ischi (!) to keep the animal spirits flowing.

Tue 3 Sep @ 18:15
Families converged: 56/75 WALS, 52/81 Grambank. Leaving this running; will check again either tomorrow or on Thursday.

Thu 5 Sep @ 10:30
Families converged: 68/75 WALS, 72/81 Grambank. Grambank has stopped, not sure why. Halting WALS as well, going to install second GPU!

Thu 5 Sep @ 14:10
Families converged: 68/75 WALS, 72/81 Grambank. Stopped each analysis in order to obtain posterior distributions and run the model and correlations on this set of families. After that, will continue MrBayes analysis with remaining families.

Thu 5 Sep @ 14:15
On second thought, it is enough to stop just one of the MrBayes analyses, as these now happen on the GPU whilst model and correlations are computed on the CPU. Hence, now doing model and correlations and WALS, and MrBayes on Grambank, simultaneously.

Thu 5 Sep @ 14:45
New GPU reports "unknown error"! However, mb still seems to be running...

Thu 5 Sep @ 15:15
WALS model + correlations finished. So: it takes about an hour for one dataset..

Thu 5 Sep @ 16:00
Having restarted computer, both GPUs are recognized again... running analyses again. However, will now exclude Austronesian temporarily, as it turns out to be so problematic. Hoping that, by tomorrow, some of the other remaining families will have converged. Also: restarted Atlantic-Congo and Nakh-Dagestanian in WALS from scratch, as these families were constantly exiting with errors, perhaps something to do with checkpointing gone awry.

Thu 5 Sep @ 17:45
Families converged: 69/75 WALS, 72/81 Grambank.

Thu 5 Sep @ 18:30
Families converged still at 69/75 WALS, 72/81 Grambank. Going home!

Fri 6 Sep @ 10:30
Families converged: 69/75, 75/81. New GPU has again disappeared (???).

Fri 6 Sep @ 12:40
Changing nstep from 100K to 1M. MrBayes reports parameters may be undersampled for certain families. Also swapping GPUs between families, so that WALS goes on the "good" one, i.e. the one that has never crashed so far.

Fri 6 Sep @ 13:45
Families converged still at the same values. Going to disable Metropolis coupling now (nchains=1), perhaps we don't need heated chains, at least not for all families.

Fri 6 Sep @ 13:50
Ah nope - the above won't work, can't continue with one chain from a checkpoint that used 4 chains. So reverting back to four chains again now.

Fri 6 Sep @ 14:30
Trying a higher temperature (temp=0.8).

Fri 6 Sep @ 15:00
It looks like in many (all?) cases, 8 CPUs in MPI implementation are quicker than 1 GPU in non-MPI implementation. Trying new strategy: put Austronesian on GPUs, one GPU per dataset, and do the rest on CPUs. Temp=0.8 seems to work quite well, so keeping that. Families converged: 69 and 76 (yay!).

Fri 6 Sep @ 15:15
Families converged: 70/75, 76/81.

Fri 6 Sep @ 15:40
I think the optimal thing is to set the small/large family cutoff at 1.5MB of the nexus file size. This leaves things like Austronesian, Atlantic-Congo and Sino-Tibetan as large, and all the rest as small. I will now do large on GPU and small on CPU. I think this is the fastest way.

Fri 6 Sep @ 16:40
Going home. Families converged still at 70/75, 76/81.

Mon 9 Sep @ 11:40
Families converged: 71/75, 78/81. Put temperature back to 0.2. Modified script so that logs are printed at the end of each "epoch", i.e. every nruns. This way we'll hopefully be able to track how the convergence diagnostics evolve. Strategy for remaining families: Austronesian on GPU for each dataset; the rest on CPUs. Running 4 CPU + 8 CPU + 1 GPU + 1 GPU at any given time.

Mon 9 Sep @ 13:10
Realized more than one family fits on a single GPU. Put two on each now, Austronesian and Atlantic-Congo, plus one more on one of the GPUs (Sino-Tibetan, Grambank). Siouan, WALS, is running on CPU. I believe this is the most efficient use of the available resources for the remaining families (assuming there's nothing we can do about Chibchan on WALS - though I should still try higher temperatures, maybe more chains, with it).

Mon 9 Sep @ 14:30
Trying Siouan (WALS) at temperature = 1.2 and nrun = 10M.

Wed 11 Sep @ 11:40
Families converged still at same numbers. Looking at convergence parameter logs, there appears to have been good progress for Grambank Atlantic-Congo and moderate progress for Grambank Sino-Tibetan, but bad performance on all WALS families; in particular, Siouan appears impossible to converge. Second GPU "fell off the bus" again, not sure if hardware or software issue. Tried setting some kernel boot parameters if latter. Once new power supply connectivity arrives, will use a dedicated power supply (and more fans) to probe if former. Had to do a hard restart; continuing analysis with WALS Austronesian, WALS Atlantic-Congo and Grambank Sino-Tibetan on gpu1, Grambank Austronesian and Atlantic-Congo on gpu2.

Wed 11 Sep @ 14:15
Something has gone awry with Austronesian in Grambank; it exits with an error once the MCMC has completed... can't think of anything else to do except delete the checkpointing file and start from scratch.

Wed 11 Sep @ 14:25
Perhaps fastest way, after all, is BEAGLE+CUDA, i.e. 8 CPU + 1 GPU working on a single family. Trying this now on WALS Austronesian and Grambank Atlantic-Congo.

Wed 11 Sep @ 14:55
Updated BIOS to see if that helps at all with the bus issue. Returning to running W Austronesian and G Atlantic-Congo as described in previous log entry.

Wed 11 Sep @ 15:00
It looks like, with this setup, G Atlantic-Congo might take something like 40 minutes for one "epoch". Need to benchmark and see if this is actually quicker than running it on GPU with no BEAGLE. W Austronesian also predicted to take on the order of 40 minutes. This doesn't seem too bad!

Wed 11 Sep @ 16:50
Temporarily halted above analyses. Trying the following from scratch with nchains=1 in the temporary phylo2 directory: W Austronesian, W Atlantic-Congo, G Austronesian, G Sino-Tibetan.

Wed 11 Sep @ 17:35
Things are proceeding swimmingly in phylo2. Starting from scratch seems to have been the right thing to do. Now working in phylo3 to prettify code and prepare it for the final "production run".

Wed 11 Sep @ 18:35
Interrupted phylo2 runs to try out new, phylo3 code. The latter has the following benefits: (1) it uses MrBayes' BEAGLE autoestimation procedure to select the best computing resource; (2) it cycles through families "optimally", taking big and small families simultaneously; (3) it produces sensible logs. We'll see how many families will have converged by tomorrow!

Thu 12 Sep @ 11:15
Families converged (in phylo3): WALS 58/75, Grambank 67/81. Both GPUs running, at 43C and 55C. Not sure extra cooling is necessary, after all! Or extra power, for that matter. Either BIOS update solved the "falling of the bus" problem, or else problem only occurs when GPU is idling (which with the phylo3 version of runMrBayes.jl happens only rarely). Going to install the two extra chassis fans anyway, since they're here.

Thu 12 Sep @ 11:45
Fans installed. Continuing with phylo3.

Thu 12 Sep @ 12:35
Shoot - realized I made a mistake. When the phylo3 version of runMrBayes.jl is called again after halting it, analysis does not continue from checkpointing file but rather from scratch. So now we effectively need to restart. No biggie - lost just half a day's computing time.

Thu 12 Sep @ 12:40
Analysis (phylo3) restarted.

Thu 12 Sep @ 13:00
Bloody h*** - forgot to copy src/code/runMrBayes.jl to the wals and grambank directories; hence need to restart analysis again. Set up cron job to automatically update status on github every four hours, so can monitor this from home. Logs are also automatically printed into log.pdf.

Thu 12 Sep @ 13:05
Analysis restarted (from scratch).

Thu 12 Sep @ 16:00
Computer randomly restarts (AMD bug alive again?). Families converged: 30/75 and 21/81. Continuing from here.

Thu 12 Sep @ 16:30
Aborting run: noticed that only 8-pin power supply is connected for CPU; will attach 8+4 now. Will also recheck BIOS settings in a quest to attain stability.

Thu 12 Sep @ 17:00
Undervolted CPU to 1.1V and set multiplier to 35.00 for a target frequency of 3.5GHz. Resuming analysis. Families converged at this time: 38/75 and 28/81.

Thu 12 Sep @ 17:35
Noticed that only 12 mb instances were running instead of the 16 (=8+8) expected. This must be due to the following: in case a run fails for a family for any reason, mb exits with an error and the Julia worker for that family terminates execution. Have now wrapped mb in a try-catch block in runMrBayes.jl, so this should not happen. Continuing. Families converged at this time: 40/75 and 31/81.

Thu 12 Sep @17:40
Going home. Families converged: 42/75, 35/81.
