Set (overhauled) MrBayes in motion for Grambank, with 3 processors for the 3 large families and 12 processors for the remaining families.

80 out of 89 families have converged. However, 5 families had not even started (i.e. they do not appear in mrbayes/logs) for some reason, so I've started them separately now. These are Afro-Asiatic, Austroasiatic, Indo-European, Arawakan and Chocoan.

The following families are doing poorly in Grambank, and thus ought to be moved to the problematic set: Nakh-Daghestanian, Siouan.

Nakh-Daghestanian has converged. Siouan not going anywhere, so moved it over to the problematic set and relaunched. Out of 89 families, 87 have now converged; the other remaining family is Austronesian, which is already very close (ASDSF=0.0086, PSRF=1.34).
