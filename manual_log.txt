Set (overhauled) MrBayes in motion for Grambank, with 3 processors for the 3 large families and 12 processors for the remaining families.

17/01/2025 @ 11:55
80 out of 89 families have converged. However, 5 families had not even started (i.e. they do not appear in mrbayes/logs) for some reason, so I've started them separately now. These are Afro-Asiatic, Austroasiatic, Indo-European, Arawakan and Chocoan.

The following families are doing poorly in Grambank, and thus ought to be moved to the problematic set: Nakh-Daghestanian, Siouan.

20/01/2025 @ 13:10
Nakh-Daghestanian has converged. Siouan not going anywhere, so moved it over to the problematic set and relaunched. Out of 89 families, 87 have now converged; the other remaining family is Austronesian, which is already very close (ASDSF=0.0086, PSRF=1.34).

Remaining families converged this morning. Sampling posterior trees now and launching CTMC model. (All this for Grambank.)

24/01/2025 @ 19:15
Now running CTMC model on Grambank, all families included. 45 feature pairs in total, divided into 5 script files each running 9 pairs in series; i.e. we run (up to) 5 pairs in parallel at any given time. Expect this to take on the order of 1 day, so should be done when I'm back in the office on Monday, at which point all that remains to do is to run the correlations.

Started what is hopefully the final rerun of everything, just to double-check.

01/09/2025 @ 13:45
Running model now for Grambank downsampled entirely. After this, should run model for Grambank where only Austronesian is downsampled. WALS is already a-okay.
